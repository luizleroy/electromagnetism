  abstract = {Managing convergence and diversity is essential in the design of Multiobjective
	Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) in search for an accurate and
	well-distributed approximation of the true Pareto-optimal front.
	Largely due to its fast convergence, Particle Swarm Optimization
	incurs a rapid loss of diversity during the evolutionary process.
	Many mechanisms have been proposed in existing MOPSOs in terms of
	leader selection, archive maintenance, and perturbation to tackle
	this deficiency. However, few MOPSOs are designed to dynamically
	adjust the balance in exploration and exploitation according to the
	feedback information detected from the evolutionary environment.
	In this paper, a novel method, named Parallel Cell Coordinate System
	(PCCS), is proposed to assess the evolutionary environment including
	density, rank, and diversity indicators based on the measurements
	of parallel cell distance, potential, and distribution entropy, respectively.
	Based on the PCCS, strategies proposed for selecting global best
	and personal best, maintaining archive, adjusting flight parameters,
	and perturbing stagnation are integrated into a self-adaptive MOPSO,
	abbreviated as pccsAMOPSO. The comparative experimental results show
	that the proposed pccsAMOPSO outperforms the other eight state-of-the-art
	competitors on ZDT and DTLZ test suites in terms of the chosen performance
	metrics. An additional experiment for density estimation in MOPSO
	illustrates that the performance of PCCS is superior to that of adaptive
	grid and crowding distance in terms of convergence and diversity.},

	many contributions reporting on parallel and distributed models and

	from the most natural and simple ones, i.e. fitness-level embarrassingly
	parallel implementations (where, for instance, each candidate solution
	is treated as an independent agent and evaluated on a dedicated processor),
	to many more sophisticated variously interacting multi-population
	systems. In the last few years, researchers have dedicated a growing
	attention to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a bio-inspired population
	based heuristic inspired by the behavior of flocks of birds and shoals
	of fish, given its extremely simple implementation and its high intrinsical
	parallelism. Several parallel and distributed models of PSO have
	been recently defined, showing interesting performances both on benchmarks
	and real-life applications. In this chapter we report on four parallel
	and distributed PSO methods that have recently been proposed. They
	consist in a genetic algorithm whose individuals are co-evolving
	swarms, an island model- based multi-swarm system, where swarms
	are independent and interact by means of particle migrations at regular
	time steps, and their respective variants enriched by adding a repulsive
